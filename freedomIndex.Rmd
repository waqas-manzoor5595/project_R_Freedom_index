# Freedom Index
#### About the Data
From `Wikipedia`, the free encyclopedia
This article contains a list of freedom indices produced by several non-governmental organizations that publish and maintain assessments of the state of freedom in the world, according to their own various definitions of the term, and rank countries as being free, partly free, or using various measures of freedom, including civil liberties, political rights and economic rights. Some of the indices measure only some aspects of freedom, such as democracy or corruption.
